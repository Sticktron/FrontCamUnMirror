## FrontCamUnMirror

Un-Mirror the Front Camera's Live Preview!

When using the front-facing camera in iOS the preview is mirrored.
The [r/jailbreak/](http://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/) community requested a way to toggle the mirroring on/off.
This tweak adds a toggle button to the UI when the front facing camera is active.
