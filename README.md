## FrontCamUnMirror

Un-mirror the camera preview when taking selfies.

The built-in camera software in iOS mirrors the preview screen (viewfinder) when taking selfies.
Why? Because people are used to seeing themselves in a mirror in real life, so it seems more natural.

This tweak adds an un-mirror button to the toolbar when using the front-facing camera.


### Device Compatibility

* iPhone/iPod: iOS 7 - 9.
* iPad: iOS 9.

Thanks to the /r/jailbreak community for the idea and testing.
