### Status -- iOS 8 update incoming !!!


## FrontCamUnMirror

Un-mirrors the front-facing camera's preview.

The built-in (native) camera software in iOS mirrors the preview screen (viewfinder) when taking selfies.
Why? Because people are used to seeing themselves in a mirror in real life, so it seems more natural.
Is the output also mirrored? No, the camera always captures and outputs exactly what it sees.

This tweak adds a new toolbar button when using the system camera UI and the front facing camera is active.


### Device Compatibility

* iOS 7.x - 8.x
* Any device with a camera


### TODOs

* TODO: handle landscape mode
* TODO: new button to "link" output to preview transformation
* TODO: add support for other apps: Messages?, SnapChat?, ...


### Credits

Thanks to the /r/jailbreak community for the idea and testing.
